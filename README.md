SparkFun OpenLog Artemis : GNSS Logger with ZMODEM Support
===========================================================

** UPDATE **
This OLA fork merges SD card read/write operations from the legacy OLA into the GNSS Logger firmware.

You can access the original SparkFun OpenLog Artemis firmware [here](https://github.com/sparkfun/OpenLog_Artemis), which includes ZMODEM support to download log files through a serial interface via USB-C cable.

You can access the specialized GNSS Logger fork of the SparkFun OLA firmware [here](https://github.com/sparkfun/OpenLog_Artemis_GNSS_Logger), which does a fine job logging GNSS observations, but does not contain ZMODEM support.

This repo does not include firmware binaries; you will have to compile from source. Install the Arduino IDE and follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/brewfalconenterprises/OpenLog_Artemis_GNSS_Logger_ZMODEM/blob/main/COMPILE_BINARY.md).

[*SparkFun OpenLog Artemis (SPX-16832)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16832)

The OpenLog Artemis is an open source datalogger that comes preprogrammed to automatically log IMU, GPS, serial data, and various pressure, humidity, and distance sensors. All without writing a single line of code! OLA automatically detects, configures, and logs Qwiic sensors. OLA is designed for users who just need to capture a bunch of data to SD and get back to their larger project.

The firmware in this repo is dedicated to logging data from the latest u-blox GNSS modules. [You can find the main OpenLog Artemis repo here](https://github.com/sparkfun/OpenLog_Artemis).

Data is logged to SD card in u-blox's UBX format without being processed. From v2.0, you can also optionally log NMEA messages too - into the same file as the UBX data. The files can be analyzed with (e.g.)
[u-center](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/u-center) or RTKLIB. You will find everything you need to know about exploring precision GPS/GNSS with RTKLIB over at
[rtklibexplorer.wordpress.com](https://rtklibexplorer.wordpress.com/). We have written our own Python 3 [UBX Integrity Checker](./Utils) which you may find useful.

OpenLog Artemis is highly configurable over an easy to use serial interface. Simply plug in a USB C cable and open a terminal at 115200kbps. The logging output is automatically streamed to both the terminal and the microSD. Pressing any key will open the configuration menu.

The OpenLog Artemis automatically scans, detects, configures, and logs data from a Qwiic GNSS sensor plugged into the board (no soldering required!). From v2.0 (based on v2.1.0 of the Apollo3 core) all u-blox Series 8, 9 and 10 modules are supported:

* [ZED-F9P](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15136)

New features are constantly being added so weâ€™ve released an easy to use firmware upgrade tool. No need to install Arduino or a bunch of libraries, simply open the [Artemis Firmware Upload GUI](https://github.com/sparkfun/Artemis-Firmware-Upload-GUI), load the latest OLA firmware, and add features to OpenLog Artemis as they come out! Full instructions are available in [UPGRADE.md](./UPGRADE.md).

Versions
--------

The latest version of this firmware (v3.0) was written for the latest u-blox modules (F9 and M10) which no longer support messages like UBX-CFG-PRT and UB-CFG-MSG.
v3.0 uses the Configuration Interface (VALSET and VALGET) to configure the module. It is built around v3 of the SparkFun u-blox GNSS library.

Please note: v3.0 is not backward compatible with v2.2. If you have an older M8 module, please continue to use v2.2. v3.0 will only work with newer modules
(F9, M10) which support the Configuration Interface.

Please see [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for details.
